## Modification

In order to modify the SCSS, you will need a SASS/SCSS compiler. We reccomend [this one](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=glenn2223.live-sass) for VS code.
To make sure that the compiled CSS files go into the correct directory, go to the extension settings, open the settings.json file, and then set the **savePath** to `/dist/css/`
```
{
  "format": "expanded",
  "extensionName": ".css",
  "savePath": "/dist/css/"
}
```
